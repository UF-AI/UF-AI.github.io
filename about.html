                The University of Florida's Artificial Intelligence Club is a group dedicated towards the research, discussion,
                and implementation of artificial intelligence.

                Founded in the spring of 2016 as a special interest group within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the AI Club aims to create both a learning environment and a community centered around artificial intelligence. To achieve this, we meet weekly, with one day dedicated towards watching and discussing content from Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning, and the other towards hosting events like research talks and movie nights. We also have several on-going projects for our members to gain actual, hands-on experience programming different aspects of artificial intelligence systems.
