                The University of Florida's Artificial Intelligence Club is a group dedicated to the study, discussion, and application of artificial intelligence.

                Founded in the spring of 2016 as a special interest group within UF's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter, the AI Club aims to foster a welcoming community of students interested in artificial intelligence. This semester we will be focusing on our bootcamp program intended to prepare our members to compete in data science competitions hosted by organizations such as Kaggle. We hope for our members to come away from our workshops having gained understanding of and familiarity with intelligent systems as well as practical experience implementing and applying them.
