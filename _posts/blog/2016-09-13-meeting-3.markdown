# What Did We Do?

We covered coursera session #1

We covered the differences between supervised learning (and within it, classification versus regression problems) and unsupervised learning (and within it, clustering).

Supplementary notes for all of the lectures can be found [here for Andrew Ng's documents](https://pythonandr.com/2015/11/25/supplementary-material-to-andrew-ngs-machine-learning-mooc/) and  [here for the regression analysis learning](http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/01_02_Introduction_regression_analysis_and_gr.html).
