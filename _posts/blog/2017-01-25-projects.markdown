# Projects for 2017

There are three projects available this semester, each led by a graduate project manager. The projects are:    

* Text generation by Srishti Mishra (srishtipmishra@gmail.com)
* Reinforcement learning game by Shesh Mishra (sheshnath.mishra1990@gmail.com)
* Voice controlled bot by Yash Jain (yjain1@ufl.edu)   

To join a project, email the managers ASAP requesting to be on the team. Please only get involved if you will dedicate time throughout the semester. (approx. 1-3 hours a week).
