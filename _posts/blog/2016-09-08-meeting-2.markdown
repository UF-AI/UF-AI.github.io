# What Did We Do?

Today we discussed different projects to work on throughout fall and spring.

Quick re-cap for those who didn't get a chance to come out to our project discussion meeting (or even if you haven't come out to any meetings at all yet!): we are in the process of choosing which AI projects to work on, so on Facebook you'll see project ideas in a poll. Go select one if you want to be on a project.
