# What Did We Do?

We held UF Artificial Intelligence Club's first General Body Meeting of the semester in Matherly Hall Room 103.

We discussed upcoming events the club will be holding, the basics of AI, other clubs available at UF, as well as available projects and the logistics to join a project team.

Everyone with any interest in artificial intelligence was welcome! No previous experience with artificial intelligence was required.

We had pizza and refreshments for all attendees!
