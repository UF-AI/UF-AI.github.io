# What Did We Do?

We coded in Python using the jupyter notebook. We used the ~70% of the titanic data set to predict whether or not someone will survive based on variables such as age, class, and sex. Once we trained our RandomForestClassifier on the training data, we used the remaining 30% to predict and test the model for accuracy of prediction.

We then compared the accuracies of the Random Forest algorithm to the Support Vector Machine algorithm (SVM).
