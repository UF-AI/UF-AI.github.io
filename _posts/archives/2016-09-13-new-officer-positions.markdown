# New Officer Positions

Some important news from today’s meeting:
We have several positions opening up in the club!

1. Secretary
  * Documentation of executive meetings
  * Room reservations
  * Create summaries of meetings for the website/FB posting
2. __3__ project managers
  * We are all in this together for learning AI. You do NOT need to know everything about the project before starting, but we want technically inclined leaders.
  * You will oversee a project of your choice and coordinate with members of the group.
  * You are in charge of delegating tasks, communicating progress to officers, facilitating learning, and implementing the project with your group.

### Reminder
 Project 1: Reinforcement Learning Game (Atari, pacman, pong, mario, flappy bird, etc.)
 Project 2: Cleverbot/FB Messengerbot/Twitterbot
 Project 3: Deep Learning Script/Text Generation

If you have experience in programing or a desire to learn rapidly (particularly for AI but as we are all learning together, this isn’t necessary to lead a group), please apply for one of these positions! The projects may seem intimidating, but keep in mind that they are ultimately about learning, and thus will be taken slowly and done over the entire school year.

## Next Week
Next Tuesday, 9/20, we will cover topics in Coursera Week 1: Model Representation, Cost Function, and possibly Gradient Descent.
